# Face Recognition
In the course TNM034 - Advanced Image Processing, the task for the project was to implement a software for face recognition.

From an input image of an unknown face, the program is able to detect the face, extract relevant features and make a decision if the face in the image belongs to a known person and, if so, to whom.
